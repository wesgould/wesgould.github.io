      <description>Creating an NFS share#  If you are trying to share between *nix systems, the Network File Servers (NFS) are really easy to set up. Note: If you are planning on sharing with Windows machines, SMB/Samba is a better option.
It should also be noted that NFS doesn&amp;rsquo;t restrict, by default, to individual users. It limits to IPs and IP ranges&amp;ndash;which makes it ideal for secure networks, but less-than-ideal for non-secure / public networks.</description>
