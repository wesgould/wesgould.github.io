2. Roast the tomatoes# Place the cherry tomatoes in a baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil, ensuring the bottom is coated. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes (if using), minced garlic, parsley, and oregano. Toss gently to coat everything evenly. Bake for 20\u201330 minutes, until the tomato skins burst. If some hold their shape, gently press them with the back of a spoon to help them burst. 3. Make the crostinis# While tomatoes are roasting, slice the baguette into ~\xBC- to \xBD-inch slices. In a small bowl, mix softened butter, minced garlic, a pinch of salt, parsley, and Parmesan (if using). Spread this garlic butter mixture onto each bread slice. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet and toast for 5\u20137 minutes, or until golden brown and crunchy. You can do this simultaneously with the tomatoes if your oven has space. 4. Assemble and serve# When the tomatoes are done, remove the baking dish from the oven. Immediately top with torn basil, grated Parmesan, and the burrata (or burrata filling). Gently stir everything so the warm tomatoes mingle with the creamy cheese. Transfer to a serving bowl or keep in the baking dish. Serve hot, alongside the garlic crostinis. Tips &amp; notes# Use very ripe tomatoes\u2014they&rsquo;ll burst more easily and release more flavor. If your burrata is whole, you can cut it open and stir in the creamy center, or just place the whole ball on top and break it when serving. For extra garlic flavor, rub a toasted crostini with a raw cut garlic clove. For more heat, increase red pepper flakes or drizzle with spicy olive oil just before serving. `}).add({id:1,href:"/blog/open-webui/",title:"Using open-webui as a local ChatGPT replacement",description:`Using open-webui# I set up a local LLM using ROCm on my desktop in my last post.

So I have the LLM running locally, but its pretty clunky and as a paying user of ChatGPT, I want that cleaner UI/UX. Enter open-webui. This is exactly what I was looking for as a front-end for the ollama server I set up.
I decided to go with the Docker setup.
Since I fairly recently refreshed my install for Pop, I realized I didn&rsquo;t have Docker installed on my machine anymore. Setting up Docker on Pop is straightforward:
Install Docker# # Add Docker&#39;s official GPG key: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc # Add the repository to Apt sources: echo \\ &#34;deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $(. /etc/os-release &amp;&amp; echo &#34;$VERSION_CODENAME&#34;) stable&#34; | \\ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin You can check that Docker is installed by running docker --version. I prefer Docker Compose when I run containers.
Docker Compose Configuration# This is what my compose file looks like:
version: &#39;3.8&#39; # Specify the version of Docker Compose services: open-webui: image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main container_name: open-webui environment: - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 volumes: - /location/on/host/tosavedata:/app/backend/data network_mode: host restart: always At this point, when you go to localhost:8080 you will see the web front end.
The Interface# The service makes you create an account. Its all local. Nothing is sent anywhere. There is a flag you can set when you spin up your docker container, but I decided to leave it this way since I may eventually set this up so my wife can use it too.
The interface is very familiar if you&rsquo;ve used ChatGPT before. Up at the top you can select your model to use. Its worth setting a default. It doesn&rsquo;t make you set a default, but it gets pretty annoying to open a new chat and have to manually pick a model each time. In my opinion, they should have it select a default on first use, but its not a huge deal at the end of the day.
And that&rsquo;s really it. Now you have a ChatGPT like UX that lets you quickly switch between models, remembers your chats if you need to go back and reference them, and its all running locally.
I plan on running LM Studio as well. Its a little more conducive to &lsquo;playing&rsquo; with the models and prompts and it gives easier access to a lot of the uncensored models that don&rsquo;t have the nanny protections built in. I also plan on setting up a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)with some of my own data to see how useful I can make all of this.

The last time I tried this, I needed to add ubuntu repos, edit my /etc/os-release file to pretend I was using ubuntu&quot;, and do a rain-dance to get my Raedeon 6900xt in a usable state.
Then once that was done, you realize that none of the software and libraries incorporated ROCm support and get really sad that you sold your Nvidia GFX card because &ldquo;radeon works better on linux&rdquo;. Basically, 2 years ago, getting ROCm setup was a pain in the ass and your only reward was buggy or nonfunctioning software since the AI/ML world is built on CUDA. Now it&rsquo;s much better with ROCm supporting CUDA and/or most of the libraries incorporating ROCm. Things like pytorch now support AMD ROCm natively.
Getting ROCm installed on Pop!_OS has been simplified to copying and pasting some commands:# wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key -O - | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg &gt; /dev/null echo &#34;deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/6.1 jammy main&#34; | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list echo -e &#39;Package: *\\nPin: release o=repo.radeon.com\\nPin-Priority: 600&#39; | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/rocm-pin-600 Then update and install:
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install rocm Add user to the &lsquo;render&rsquo; group so your user profile has permission to use it.
sudo usermod -a -G render $USER You can confirm it all works with:
rocminfo Installing the actual language models:# Since we have ROCm installed and working properly, let&rsquo;s install a local LLM. I decided to use Ollama, which is Meta&rsquo;s open source model. Ollama.ai actually has a script that helps get it all up-and-running quickly. They even have a Linux version.
I hate that this has become a common practice in the *nix community, because it&rsquo;s such a huge security risk, but they offer a script you can run if you copy and paste this command:
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh Only do this if you have reviewed the script and/or can REALLY trust the source. You are downloading a script from the internet and piping it into your shell to run.
There are manual steps here, though, that you can follow if you don&rsquo;t want to use the script: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md
I ran the script (after I reviewed it!). If you&rsquo;ve done everything properly, you should be able to type:
ollama run llama3 The first time you run this it will download llama3, which can take a bit, but it will drop you into a prompt. Where you can talk to it like you would ChatGPT or any other LLM.
And thats that! A working LLM on Pop!_OS using ROCm on your Radeon GFX card! The next step is adding a more user friendly, ChatGPT-like interface for it. This way you can discover and switch models easily, save your history, and easily set system prompts and your own guardrails&ndash;all locally, and privately. That will be on the next post when I have some time to tinker with it.

Wash and dry each bell pepper, then cut the bell peppers in half horizontally. Make sure to cut them as evenly as possible. Using a sharp paring knife carefully cut and remove the stem from the top half of each bell pepper (see picture below). It&rsquo;s okay if there is a small hole left where the stem was removed. Prepare the bell peppers. Place each bell pepper half in a 9\xD713-inch casserole dish. Brush the bell peppers with 1 Tbsp oil and season with \xBC tsp of salt and \xBC tsp cracked black pepper. Bake the bell peppers in a preheated oven for 20 minutes to soften. After 20 minutes remove the bell peppers from the oven and set aside. Make the filling.

Once boiling, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to simmer, without lifting the lid or stirring, for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest, without lifting the lid, for an additional 5 minutes. Fill the bell peppers. Next remove the lid, fluff the rice, and stir the mixture again to redistribute the ingredients. Begin to fill each bell pepper with the meat filling. Stuff as much filling as you can into each, filling them all the way to the top. Add cheese and bake. Top each bell pepper evenly with shredded mozzarella cheese. Loosely place some tented aluminum foil over the top of the casserole dish and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the bell peppers should be tender but not mushy. Broil the bell peppers. Now remove the foil and turn the heat on to broil. Broil the stuffed bell peppers for 2-3 minutes or just until the cheese gets a little brown on top. Be sure to watch the bell peppers closely at this step to prevent the cheese from over browning.

I know that seems lazy, but it&rsquo;s an extra step that caused just enough friction that I wouldn&rsquo;t update the blog.
I picked Hugo because it seemed simple, used text files vs. databases, etc., and honestly, I found a sick Gruvbox based theme that I liked. Gruvbox is the one true color palette.
Working through the kinks# Setting it up was actually really easy. I got it all working locally in about an hour, but when I went to deploy it to the S3 bucket, it just didn&rsquo;t work. I discovered that AWS S3 buckets don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;pretty URLs&rdquo;. In other words, S3 buckets need the URL with the &ldquo;.html&rdquo; at the end, or it throws an error.
The fix is using &ldquo;ugly URLs&rdquo;. This argument, added to the Hugo config.toml, should add the .html to the end of all of the URLs. It does that, but it also provides the ENTIRE URL. So, if you clicked the link to the &lsquo;blog&rsquo;, instead of going to wesgould.com/blog.html, it would go to wesgould.com/www.wesgould.com/blog.html. So either Hugo has a bug in it, or the way my particular theme is set up, that ALSO didn&rsquo;t work. After fighting it for entirely too long, I decided that I didn&rsquo;t want to recode the entire theme. I&rsquo;d just move from AWS to GitHub pages&ndash;which does support prettyURLs.
It seemed simple and would save me $0.50 a month (since getting TLS certs requires CloudFront, which costs the exorbitant $0.50/mo). It also aligned with the Git workflow I was already using.
I read a couple of tutorials but ultimately ended up following this amazing YouTube video. It walks you through creating a &ldquo;working code&rdquo; repository and a public repository where you can publish your static site content.
Hooray! This will be easy peasy!
But, I ran into another problem and beat my head against the wall. The site deployed and seemed to work fine, except for the Blog URL. It was directing me to a weird readme. The source of the page referenced Jekyll and SEO optimizations. I grepped for those strings in my code and couldn&rsquo;t find them. Long story short, the culprit was a &ldquo;gh-pages&rdquo; branch of code in my website repo. Having a gh-pages branch (designed for Jekyll) in your repo tells GitHub to kick off an automated workflow to deploy a static site. Cool.
I&rsquo;d started to follow this tutorial before I found that YouTube video. So, I had created a gh-pages branch and totally forgot about it. Apparently, that magical branch automatically injects stuff into your code/site as it&rsquo;s updated\u2014and in my case, broke the &ldquo;blog&rdquo; links. Deleting that branch fixed all of the problems.
It&rsquo;s working now, and I am looking forward to tuning it. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is that it, probably correctly, follows the system setting for light vs. dark mode, even though I&rsquo;ve set the default to dark. Light mode Gruvbox is gross. I might try to fix it and submit a PR to the theme editor. I&rsquo;ve seen other themes that let users choose the system, light, or dark.
The last thing I need to do is clean up DNS so my actual domain displays this instead of my broken S3 version.
`}).add({id:7,href:"/projects/creating-nfs-shares/",title:"Creating NFS Shares",description:`Creating an NFS share# If you are trying to share between *nix systems, the Network File Servers (NFS) are really easy to set up. Note: If you are planning on sharing with Windows machines, SMB/Samba is a better option.
It should also be noted that NFS doesn&rsquo;t restrict, by default, to individual users. It limits to IPs and IP ranges&ndash;which makes it ideal for secure networks, but less-than-ideal for non-secure / public networks.
`,content:`Creating an NFS share# If you are trying to share between *nix systems, the Network File Servers (NFS) are really easy to set up. Note: If you are planning on sharing with Windows machines, SMB/Samba is a better option.
It should also be noted that NFS doesn&rsquo;t restrict, by default, to individual users. It limits to IPs and IP ranges&ndash;which makes it ideal for secure networks, but less-than-ideal for non-secure / public networks.
It&rsquo;s pretty straight forward (on debian/apt bases distributions):
Installing the NFS server# sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server Make the directory you would like to share. This directory can go anywhere but I think standard location is in the /mnt/ directory.
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/your-directory-to-share This (below) changes the permissions to let all of the client machines access to the directory. You can change the permissions as well but for now I left it
sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/your-directory-to-share\` Give the clients read,write, and execute permissions as well:
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/your-directory-to-share\` At this point your nfs-server is installed (not active) and your shared folder is setup. Now you need to grant access to the NFS share. To do that you have to edit the &rsquo;exports&rsquo; file&ndash;which is found at /etc/exports.
sudo vim /etc/exports /mnt/your-directory-to-share &lt;ipaddress of the client&gt;(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) If you want to add specific IPs you have to create a new line for each of them. However, if you wanted to do an entire subnet/ip range you can write something like this: 192.168.1.0/24 (which would share 192.168.1.1-255)
rw = read/write ; sync = means changes have to be written to disk before they are applied ; no_subtree_check = means what it says. Apparently, subtree checking causes more problems than its worth, so most people recommend using this flag to turn it off.
According the NFS man pages and tutorials I found you are supposed to run the following in this order:
sudo exportfs -a sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server This threw an error for me. I ran them a second time and it seems to work. I think you have to have the nfs-kernel-server running before you can do sudo exportfs -a. When you run the restart command it actually starts it for the first time, then you can follow the steps properly.
If it was up to me, I think it should be:
sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server sudo exportfs -a sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server Connect your client# So now you have the server serving up the shared drive. Now you need to connect to it.
On your laptop/pc/whatever is connecting to the NFS server you need to install the NFS client and mount the drive.
sudo apt-get install nfs-common Make a directory/mount point for this. Again, this can be anywhere. If you wanted it to be in your home folder it can be, but we&rsquo;ll stick with /mnt/nfsshare
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfsshare Then you mount it:
sudo mount &lt;ip-of-NFS-server&gt;:/mnt/your-directory-to-share /mnt/nfsshare And thats it. When you navigate to /mnt/nfsshare on your client machine you will see all of the contents of the nfs drive. Which at this point would be empty.
If you want to mount it permanently, just edit your /etc/fstab file by adding a line at the end:

Ingredients# 2 cups grated cheddar cheese 1/2 cup finely chopped green onion 2 cans cream of chicken soup 1 cup sour cream 1 can chopped green chilies 1/2 tsp salt 2 cans chicken (all white meat) OR 4 chicken breasts, cooked and chopped 12 corn tortillas, hand shredded Important Ingredient Note Use Chopped Green Chilies from the Mexican Food section - these come in very small cans. DO NOT GET FIRE-ROASTED versions! The cans look almost identical but the taste is completely different. Chicken Cooking Tip Cook raw chicken breasts by placing in a sauce pan, just cover with water, and bring to boil. Turn heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes to 1 hour until no pink remains in center. Remove chicken, cool, and chop into bite-sized pieces. This keeps the meat tender and moist. Instructions# Preheat oven to 350\xB0F.

2 pounds ground beef (80:20 is good; 90:10 works as well and will obviously be less fatty) 1 6-ounce can tomato paste 4 cups water 1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce 1 large onion, minced 6 cloves garlic, minced (pre-minced in the jar is fine) 3 tablespoons chili powder 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce TIP: Measure all of your ingredients first. I usually set all of the spices on my left with a small bowl in front of me. As I measure and put each ingredient into the bowl, I move the spice bottle to the right side so I know I&rsquo;ve added it. It&rsquo;s really easy to forget which spices you&rsquo;ve measured out!

Directions# Cook the tomato paste: Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the tomato paste to the dry pot and cook, constantly scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, until the tomato smells rich and toasty and you start to see browned (not burned) patches in the bottom of the pot. This should take 1 to 3 minutes.
Combine the ingredients in a pot: Remove the pot from heat and add the ground beef and water. Mix them together into a sludge. It will not look pretty, but press on. There&rsquo;s a method to this madness. Return to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring all the while, so the sludge breaks up into a mealy paste. Add all the remaining ingredients.
Simmer gently, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours: Stir the chili often. You want the volume to reduce a bit. If it starts to lose too much water and is getting too thick, reduce the heat and cover with a lid&ndash;leaving just a bit for some steam to escape. It will be ready in an hour, but the longer you let it simmer the richer the flavor will be.

The family decided to go to a Turkey Trot before we ate Thanksgiving dinner. I bet my niece $1 that I would run it in under 40 minutes. I got &lt; 33 minutes (unofficially\u2014the times aren&rsquo;t posted yet).
About 900 people signed up for this particular 5k!
The 2nd prize was a huge pie (and a $50 Dick&rsquo;s gift card, but you can&rsquo;t eat that so it&rsquo;s less important).
