      <description>Updating DNS Records#  This was a fairly straightforward process:
 Log into GitHub &amp;gt; Go to your public repo &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Pages: and enter your domain in the Custom Domain section    Add your domain name www.wesgould.com Log into your DNS provider.  Delete CNAME / A-RECORDs for www.wesgould.com and wesgould.com to avoid conflicts with the new records. ADD CNAME RECORD for www.wesgould.com. Add A-RECORD for wesgould.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been an&amp;hellip;adventure.
Why Switch from Publii to Hugo?#  I am switching from Publii to Hugo because I wanted to take advantage of the text notes I was already taking with Vimwiki for my various projects. The Publii interface was nice, but I&amp;rsquo;m already writing notes in a format that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require me to use their WYSIWYG editor. I know that seems lazy, but it&amp;rsquo;s an extra step that caused just enough friction that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t update the blog.</description>

      <description>Turkey Trot 2k19#  Date: November 28, 2019
The family decided to go to a Turkey Trot before we ate Thanksgiving dinner. I bet my niece $1 that I would run it in under 40 minutes. I got &amp;lt; 33 minutes (unofficially—the times aren&amp;rsquo;t posted yet).
About 900 people signed up for this particular 5k!
The 2nd prize was a huge pie (and a $50 Dick&amp;rsquo;s gift card, but you can&amp;rsquo;t eat that so it&amp;rsquo;s less important).</description>
